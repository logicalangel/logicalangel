- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Parya Rastegar
- Software Development and its infrastructure is my passion, and I enjoy learning new skills in different languages as well as exploring different technologies to find my path through the development world. I also enjoy reading about products, watching movies and listening to music. And I am a firm believer of being happy and successful in all aspects of life. In order to improve, one must be able to help others around them along the way. Being a great person means working as a team, being patient, helpful and loving what you do
